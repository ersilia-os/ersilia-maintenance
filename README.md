# 🔧 Workflows Overview

This repository contains **three major automated workflows**.

---

## 1. **Repo Data Sync**  
**File:** `.github/workflows/repo_data_sync.yml`  
**Runs:** Every **10 days**  
**Purpose:** Synchronizes Ersilia model metadata + generates the **Model Report**.

### What it does:
- Fetches metadata from all model repositories.
- Updates:
  - `repo_info.json` (core dataset)
  - last update/test dates
  - open issues
  - release + packaging dates
  - source type & subtask
- Updates rolling history (`monthly_health_history.json`).
- Rebuilds the monthly health plots.
- **Generates:**  
  📄 `reports/model_report.md` → *Full model catalog summary*

---

## 2. **Weekly Model Testing**  
**File:** `.github/workflows/test_models.yml`  
**Runs:** Every **Monday at 10:00 UTC**  
**Purpose:** Select and test a weekly subset of models.

### Workflow stages:
#### 🔹 **Job 1 – Pick weekly models**
- Runs `pick_repo.py`.
- Writes list to:  
  - `files/picked_weekly.json`  
- Commits changes back to the repo.

#### 🔹 **Job 2 – Test models**
- Pulls the newly generated `picked_weekly.json`.
- Tests models using the Ersilia CLI.
- Generates:
  - `weekly_test_results.txt`
  - `weekly_test_summary.txt`
  - `weekly_model_testing.md`

---

## 3. **Monthly Model Health Report**  
**File:** `.github/workflows/monthly_health.yml`  
**Runs:** **1st day of each month at 00:00 UTC**  
**Purpose:** Generate ecosystem-level analytics and trend plots.

### What it produces:
- Trends over time:
  - Healthy / failing / outdated
  - Tested vs never tested
  - Open issues
  - Newly packaged models
- Current snapshot distributions:
  - Source type
  - Subtask
- Updates `monthly_health_history.json`
- Generates final report:  
  📄 `monthly_health_report.md`
